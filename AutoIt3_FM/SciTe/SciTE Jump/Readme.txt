  SciTE Jump V2.18.103.243

-----------------------------

Website: http://softwarespot.wordpress.com/code/scite-jump/
Language: Multi-language

  Description
-----------------------------
SciTE Jump is a useful addition to SciTE4AutoIt3 as it allows you to quickly navigate between functions and regions in an AutoIt script. This is especially ideal because it allows you to export your code to HTML, Latex, PDF, RTF, XML and you can also export the list of functions contained in your code.

Use the hotkey F1 to display the in-built help file.

How to Install
-----------------------------
Note: Now officially included in the SciTE4AutoIt3 package.

SciTE Jump can be run 'straight out of the box' but if you wish to integrate into SciTE then right click on the titlebar and select 'Add to SciTE.' This will then allow you to access SciTE Jump by calling the hotkey Alt + Q.


  GUI
-----------------------------
The GUI is designed to be simple thus allowing you to create code quickly and efficiently. The inputs at the top are for searching the function list as well as navigating to a specific line within the code. The input in the lower portion of the GUI is for searching a keyword within an AutoIt script, you can change the location to search by selecting the folder icon. This addition is great if you only know a portion of the function you wish to use.

There are also many settings which can be changed by selecting the next button at the top of SciTE Jump. One feature is 'pixel to line', by default a function will appear at the top of SciTE, but you can offset this by selecting a number of pixels e.g. 180. Docking to the side of SciTE is also another feature that is available.

The following HotKeys are supported:
Ctrl + F - Automatically highlight the search input to search the function list.
Alt + Q - If SciTE Jump is already open and not activated then it will re-activate SciTE Jump. If SciTE Jump is active then it will re-activate SciTE.


  Extended Functionality
-----------------------------
None


  Thanks
-----------------------------
I would like to extend a big thank you to all who took the time to test the application in it's infancy. I would also like to aknowledge Ashalshaikh & Melba23 for their individual efforts in creating this application.

This program wouldn't have been possible without the wonderful community on the AutoIt Forums [http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/]
